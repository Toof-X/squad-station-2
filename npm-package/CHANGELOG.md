# Changelog

All notable changes to Squad Station are documented in this file.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-03-22

### ✨ Features

- **Auto-install SDD on init** — When initializing a project with an SDD workflow (BMad, GSD), Squad Station now automatically runs the SDD's local installer if it hasn't been installed yet. This ensures agents have the skills/commands they need before sessions launch.
  - BMad: `npx bmad-method install --directory . --modules bmm --tools <ide> --yes`
  - GSD: `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest --<provider> --local`
  - Superpower: prints manual install instructions (no automated installer)
  - Skips if already installed (checks for `_bmad/`, `.claude/commands/gsd/`, etc.)
  - Works on TUI new-project, TUI overwrite, and non-TUI init paths

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Removed deprecated `hooks/` directory (5 shell scripts) — all hook logic is now generated inline in settings.json during init
- Fixed all 17 clippy warnings: `matches!()` macro, `push('\n')`, needless borrows, print literals, `useless_format`

## v0.5.9 - 2026-03-21

### ⚡ Performance

- Replaced `list_messages().len()` with `count_processing()` in `status.rs` — eliminates unnecessary row fetching and deserialization
- Parallelized tmux `session_exists` checks in `reconcile_agent_statuses` using `futures::future::join_all` — faster with many agents
- Converted `capture_pane`/`capture_pane_alternate` from sync `std::process::Command` to async `tokio::process::Command` — unblocks tokio runtime during reconciliation
- Converted `detect_tmux_session` to async — prevents blocking on the SessionStart hook hot path
- Reused DB pool across watchdog ticks — avoids repeated connection + migration checks every 30s
- Extracted shared `build_agent_metrics` function — deduplicates fleet/context metrics logic

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed needless double-borrow `&&SqlitePool` in watchdog tick function
- Fixed missing `.await` on tmux calls in `notify.rs`, `reset.rs`, and `view.rs`
- Converted sync `std::process::Command` to async in `notify.rs` agent detection
- Fixed missing `config` import in `main.rs`

## v0.5.8 - 2026-03-20

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed `current_task` corruption when `/clear` is sent while another task is already processing — `current_task` now reverts to the real task instead of staying pointed at the completed `/clear` message

### 🧪 Tests

- Added `test_fire_and_forget_clear_while_task_processing` integration test — verifies `current_task` and agent status are correct when fire-and-forget overlaps with an in-flight task

## v0.5.7 - 2026-03-20

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed signal race condition: `/clear` followed by a real task no longer leaves the real task stuck at `processing` forever
- Root cause: `/clear` in Claude Code produces no response turn, so the Stop hook never fires — its DB message blocked the FIFO signal queue, causing subsequent signals to complete the wrong task
- Fire-and-forget commands (e.g. `/clear`, `/clear hard`) are now auto-completed at send time in `send.rs`
- Agent status correctly resets to idle after fire-and-forget if no other tasks are queued

### 🧪 Tests

- Added `is_fire_and_forget` unit tests (positive + negative cases)
- Added `test_fire_and_forget_clear_auto_completed` integration test — reproduces the exact race condition and verifies signal targets the correct task

## v0.5.6 - 2026-03-20

### 🌟 Highlights

- `/clear` context management upgraded from vague guidance to **hard rules** — weaker models (Haiku) no longer ignore `/clear` decisions

### 🎁 Features

- Mandatory `/clear` triggers: topic shift, 3-task threshold, agent hint detection
- Pre-send checklist added to orchestrator playbook — run before every `squad-station send`
- Explicit `How to /clear` section with code example
- QA Gate step 5 now says "Run the `/clear` checklist" instead of "Decide if `/clear` is needed"

### 🔧 Maintenance

- Version bumped to 0.5.6 across Cargo.toml, npm-package/package.json, and bin/run.js binary download
- npm binary download version aligned to 0.5.6 (was stuck at 0.5.3)

## v0.5.5 - 2026-03-19

### 🌟 Highlights

- Orchestrator context can now be **auto-injected** on session start, resume, or compact — no more forgetting to run `/squad-orchestrator`
- CLI simplified: `close` removed, `clean` now does everything (kill sessions + delete DB)
- New orchestrator guidance for managing agent context with `/clear`

### 🎁 Features

- `squad-station context --inject` outputs orchestrator content to stdout for SessionStart hook consumption
- Orchestrator-only guard: detects tmux session name and silently skips injection for worker agents
- Provider-aware output format: raw markdown for Claude Code, JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` for Gemini CLI
- Opt-in SessionStart hook during `squad-station init` with interactive prompt (default: No)
- New "Context Management — /clear" section in orchestrator playbook
- QA Gate now includes step 5: "Decide if `/clear` is needed before the next task"

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- `squad-station close` command removed — use `squad-station clean` instead
- `squad-station clean` now kills all tmux sessions AND deletes the database (previously only deleted the database)

### 🔧 Maintenance

- Version aligned to 0.5.5 across Cargo.toml and npm-package/package.json
- Updated SDD playbooks in npm-package
- 171 tests passing

## v0.5.3 - 2026-03-16

### 🌟 Highlights

- New PostToolUse hook catches agent questions (AskUserQuestion) and forwards them to the orchestrator
- Elicitation dialog support for permission-like prompts

### 🎁 Features

- PostToolUse hook: `AskUserQuestion` matcher notifies orchestrator when an agent asks a question
- Notification hook: added `elicitation_dialog` matcher alongside `permission_prompt`
- Orchestrator resolution fix for multi-agent squads

### 📚 Documentation

- Added README to npm-package

### 🔧 Maintenance

- `cargo fmt` formatting pass across source and tests
- 164 tests passing

## v0.5.1 - 2026-03-16

### 🌟 Highlights

- First public release as an npm package (`npx squad-station install`)
- Provider-agnostic hook system with auto-installation
- Colored, informative init output

### 🎁 Features

- `npx squad-station install` — npm package with postinstall binary download for macOS and Linux
- Colored init output with squad setup summary, hook status, and get-started instructions

- Claude Code hooks: Stop (signal) and Notification (permission_prompt) auto-installed to `.claude/settings.json`
- Gemini CLI slash command generated in TOML format (`.gemini/commands/squad-orchestrator.toml`)
- Provider-specific orchestrator context file paths resolved dynamically
- Freeze/unfreeze commands to block or allow orchestrator task dispatch
- Monitor session: tiled tmux view of all agent panes created during init
- Context command: generates unified `squad-orchestrator.md` with agent roster, routing rules, and playbook references
- Signal command: auto-detects agent from tmux pane ID, idempotent completion handling
- Full messaging pipeline: send, peek, list, signal with priority ordering (urgent > high > normal)
- SQLite WAL mode with single-writer pool and 5s busy timeout
- Literal-mode `send-keys` to prevent shell injection via tmux
- Antigravity provider support (DB-only orchestrator, no tmux session)
- SDD workflow orchestration: playbook-driven task delegation to agents
- Interactive TUI dashboard (ratatui) for monitoring agent status and messages

### 🔧 Maintenance
